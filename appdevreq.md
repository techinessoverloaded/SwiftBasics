## iOS App Developer Requirements

To develop an App for iOS, you need:
- An Apple Mac computer running the latest version of macOS.
- Xcode, which is the integrated development environment (IDE) for macOS, available as a free download from the Mac App Store.
- An active Apple Developer account, which requires a $99 annual fee.

These three requirements work together: Only active members of the Apple Developer Program can post an app to the Apple App Store. Only apps signed and published by Xcode are eligible for submission to the App Store. Xcode runs only on macOS, and macOS runs only on Apple computers.
The good news is that Xcode offers much more than just the ability to sign and publish your completed app. The IDE contains a user interface designer, code editor, testing engine, asset catalogue and more—virtually everything you need for iOS app development.
