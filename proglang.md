## Programming Languages used for iOS App Development

There are currently two programming languages for developing Native iOS Apps:

- **Objective-C** : Developed in the early 1980s, Objective-C was the primary programming language for all Apple products for decades. Derived from the C language, Objective-C is an object-oriented programming language centered on passing messages to different processes (as opposed to invoking a process in traditional C programming).

- **Swift** : The Swift programming language is the new “official” language of iOS. While it has many similarities to Objective-C, Swift is designed to use a simpler syntax and is more focused on security than its predecessor. Because it shares a run time with Objective-C, you can easily incorporate legacy code into updated apps. Because Swift is faster, more secure and easier to use than Objective-C, you should plan to use it to develop your iOS app unless you have a compelling reason to stick with Objective-C.

We can also use **Flutter SDK, React Native, Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile** or any other Cross-platform frameworks to develop Cross Platform iOS and Android Apps but we are not going to explore them as they're beyond the scope of this Blog. In this Blog, we will see about developing Native iOS Apps using **Swift**.
