## Structures in Swift
In Swift, a `struct` (Keyword for Structure) is used to store variables of different data types. It is used to create a new type out of existing types and also define functionalities (through methods) for the new type. Structures are value types in Swift, meaning they are always passed by value in functions and new copies of them are created whenever they are assigned or reassigned. This means that at any point of time, each instance of a `struct` will be stored at an unique location in the memory even when the contained value is same.

**Syntax :**
```swift
struct StructureName 
{
  // structure definition 
}
```
