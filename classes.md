## Classes in Swift
A Class is considered as a blueprint of objects. In Swift, a Class is similar to a Structure in most of the aspects. However, Swift Classes have the following unique properties and additional capabilities as compared to Structures:
- Classes are **Reference Types** unlike Structures. This means that the Objects of a Class are passed by Reference. Also, ARC allows multiple references of a class instance to exist.
- Classes support Inheritance.
- Classes support Typecasting.
- Classes can have Deinitializers (similar to **C++** Destructors) in addition to Initializers.

Due to the above mentioned capabilities, Classes in Swift can leverage all the benefits of Object-oriented Programming. Classes in Swift are marked by the `class` keyword.

**Syntax :**
```swift
class ClassName
{
   //Class Properties and Methods
}
```
