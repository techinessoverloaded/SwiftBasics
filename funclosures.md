## Functions and Closures in Swift
### Functions
A Function is a block of code that performs a specific task. In other words, it is a set of statements which can be repeatedly called and executed as and when required. Functions increase the modularity, reusability and flexibility of the overall code. Swift allows both User-defined Functions and Standard Library Functions.
