## Functions and Closures in Swift
### Functions
A Function is a block of code that performs a specific task. In other words, it is a set of statements which can be repeatedly called and executed as and when required. Functions increase the modularity, reusability and flexibility of the overall code. Swift allows both User-defined Functions and Standard Library Functions. We would have seen about two Standard Library Functions `print()` and `readLine()` in [Basic I/O](https://techinessoverloaded.github.io/iOSAppDevBasics/basicio.html). Now, let's see about User-defined Functions in Swift. User-defined Functions in Swift are declared using `func` keyword (As opposed to `fun` in **Kotlin**, `def` in **Python** and conventional functional declaration of C/C++/Java).

**Syntax :**
```swift
func functionName(paramterName1: ParameterType1, parameterName2: ParameterType2, ....) -> ReturnType
{
// Body of function
}
```

Parameters and Return Type are optional and can be given only when required.
