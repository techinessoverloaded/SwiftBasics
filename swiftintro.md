## Introduction to Swift
- As we saw earlier, Swift programming language is the new “official” language of iOS. 
- It was developed by Chris Lattner.
- Swift was first introduced by Apple in 2014 and is actively maintained by Apple.  
- It is a General Purpose Language. 
- It uses a Compiler for Code Translation. So, the entire bulk of Swift code is translated into machine code at once, as compared to Interpreters where line-by-line translation is done.
- It uses Automatic Reference Counting (ARC) for Memory Management. 
- It is easier to learn Swift for both newbies and programmers experienced in other languages.

Now, let's move on to learn about the Data Types available in Swift.
