## Variables, Literals and Constants in Swift
### Literals
Literals are used to represent data values like Int or any other Data Type value in the Source Code. 

**Example :**
```swift
45 // Int Literal
"Hello World" // String Literal
3.14 // Floating-point Literal
```
We can assign values to Variables and Constants by means if Literals.

### Variables
In the previous Topic Pages, you would have seen the word "Variable" in many places. In fact, it is quite hard to write a program without using variables. Why is it so ? It is so because, a Variable as its name suggests, is used for storing a named variable value (value that can be changed). In Swift, variables can be declared by using `var` Keyword. 

**Example :**
```swift
var a = 45 // Statement 1
var b: String = "Hello" // Statement 2
```
As we saw in the Previous Topic, Swift can infer the Data Type of variable using the assigned Literal. This kind of declaration is used in Statement 1 above. On the other hand, in Statement 2, the Data Type of the Variable is explicitly specified in the Declaration. This kind of explicit Type Specification is called as **Type Annotation** in Swift.
