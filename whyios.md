## Why iOS is quite good and popular amongst users ?

The following are the reasons why iOS is quite popular among users and why it has many loyal users :
- **iOS is quite easy to use :** iOS has an easy to use and intuitive UI. There's not much for the user to learn about, before using the iPhone.
- **Timely Updates :** Whenever a new version of iOS is released, all the iPhones which are compatible with the software get the Update immediately. However, for Android Phones, it is on the hands of OEMs on whether to release an update for the specific device and even the releases get delayed as the OS has to be optimized and customized according to the OEMs' needs.
- **Better Quality Apps :** All the third party apps which are to be released to the iOS App Store, go through an intensive sequence of quality checks, which might be annoying for some developers. But, it finally leads to better quality apps on the App Store.
- **Better Security :** Yes, Android too is quite good in terms of Security, but since iOS is not open source and is closely integrated with the Apple Ecosystem, it offers better Security.
- **Better Customer Service :** Since iPhones are made from scratch by Apple and no other OEMS are involved, customers can directly approach Apple Service centers, share their issues, and even get new devices as replacement, if required. 

Now, as we have seen why iOS is popular, we can now move on to seeing the basics of Swift Programming Language
