## Operators in Swift
Operators are the special symbols that perform operations on variables and values. Swift Operators can be divided into various categories :
1. Arithmetic Operators
2. Assignment Operators
3. Comparison Operators
4. Logical Operators
5. Bitwise Operators
6. Miscellaneous Operators

### Arithmetic Operators
Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc. Swift supports the following Arithmetic Operators:

| Operator | Operation | Example |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| `+` | Addition | `5 + 2 = 7` |
| `-` | Subtraction | `5 - 2 = 3` |
| `*` | Multiplication | `5 * 2 = 10` |
| `/` | Division | `4 / 2 = 2` |
| `%` | Modulo | `5 % 2 = 1` |

**Example :**
```swift
var a = 99
var b = 999
let c:Float
c = Float(a + b)
print("\(a) + \(b) = \(c)")
```

**Output :**
```
99 + 999 = 1098.0
```
